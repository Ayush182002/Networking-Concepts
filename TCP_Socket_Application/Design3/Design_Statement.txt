This problem aims to get rid of the imitation stated in Problem-1. The chatting mechanism
should be flexible, so sending and receiving messages should be concurrent. In other words,
sending and receiving messages should not block each other. Users may send no or multiple
messages before receiving a response from another party.
It can be achieved using the Process or Thread concept, where "reading a text from a user and
sending" job can be given to a Process or a Thread. Again, the "receiving a text message and
printing it in the console" job can be given to another Process or a Thread.
